Tyler Lindberg - 3D Plinko

This is a physics simulation involving falling colored balls bouncing through a 3D grid of spherical pegs and changing the color of the pegs in the process.

To regain control of the camera press 'c' to swap between high orbit, low orbit, and user controlled cameras.

When the camera is in orbit mode, you can click on an object in the scene in order to track its movement with the camera. (Selected objects turn yellow.)

The hierarchical objects, are the "dispensers" floating around the top of the grid. There are multiple invisible objects providing the rotational movement, and locally each dispenser has a ring rotating around it as well.

Both the rings and dispensers are custom objects that are texture mapped and flat shaded. They each have a striped texture, that is subtle unless observed up close.

By pressing 'p' you can look at the scene with the "pick shader" applied. This is the shader that allows the user to click on objects in the scene in order to select them.
