# 3D Plinko

This is a physics simulation involving colored balls bouncing through a 3D grid of spherical pegs and transferring their color to the pegs with every bounce. You can view the demo [here](https://tylindberg.github.io/3D-Plinko/).

To regain control of the camera press 'c' to swap between high orbit, low orbit, and user controlled cameras.

When the camera is in orbit mode, you can click on an object in the scene in order to track its movement with the camera. (Selected objects turn yellow.)

By pressing 'p' you can look at the scene with the "pick shader" applied. This is the shader that allows us to distinguish which object was selected when the user clicks on the screen.
